                The truth of the matter is that, if you can make a sponge cake, you can make any cake. A sponge cake is the simplest of all and you never have to remember the recipe. The ratio of the ingredirents is 100:100:100 i.e. there are only 3 ingredients. Flour, sugar, eggs in equal amounts.
